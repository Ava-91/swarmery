package ingest

// Board capture: turning what a live session DID into suggested Triage cards.
//
// Two hooks, both deliberately kept out of the ingest loop body so the loop
// keeps reading as "parse a transcript" and not "parse a transcript and also
// run the board":
//
//	Hook A — captureTodos, per assistant tool_use block. Every item of a
//	         TodoWrite call becomes one card.
//	Hook B — CaptureSessionCard, on a session's transition to a terminal
//	         status. A session that ended having produced NO todo cards gets a
//	         single card built from its first user prompt, so short "just do X"
//	         sessions are not silently lost.
//
// Three properties this file exists to guarantee:
//
//  1. It is invisible on the hot path. captureTodos rejects on the tool NAME
//     before it decodes anything; the ~30 other tools in a transcript pay one
//     string comparison per block and nothing else. The skip verdict for a
//     session is memoized, so a 500-line batch costs at most one skip query.
//
//  2. It never breaks ingest. Every failure here is logged at debug level and
//     swallowed. A board card is a convenience; a transcript is the record of
//     what happened. Losing the former must never cost the latter, and a
//     capture error must never abort — or stall — the tail batch.
//
//  3. It is permanently idempotent. capture_key ('todo:<uuid>:<sha1-12>' and
//     'sess:<uuid>') plus 0048's partial unique index mean a re-tail, a daemon
//     restart, an offset reset, or a full re-ingest of the same transcript all
//     converge on the same set of cards. Ingest replays constantly — anything
//     less would grow a fresh copy of every card on each sweep.

// an error. Both *sql.Tx and *sql.DB satisfy dbtx.
//
// The WHERE clause is the entire safety story of auto-move, and every conjunct
// earns its place:
//
//   - capture_key = ?     — only a CAPTURED card; the key is NULL on every
//     hand-written row and NULL never matches '='.
//   - board_column =
//     'in_progress'       — only work the user explicitly ACCEPTED. A card still
//     in 'triage'/'todo' is an unreviewed suggestion and does
//     not expire; one already in 'done'/'archived' is finished
//     and must never be resurrected into a live column.
//   - origin != 'manual'  — hand-written cards are untouchable. The dispatcher
//     runs its own state machine over the rows this excludes
//     (dispatch/service.go finishReview and friends). Belt and
//     braces with the key predicate above, deliberately: it is
//     asserted directly by
//     TestMoveCapturedToReviewNeverTouchesManualOrigin.
//   - worktree_path
//     IS NULL             — and origin alone is NOT enough, because origin is
//     immutable. A captured card the user reworks
//     (in_review → todo) is re-admitted by the dispatcher
//     (dispatch/service.go admit), which sets
//     board_column='in_progress', status='running' and a
//     worktree_path but CANNOT clear origin/capture_key/
//     origin_session_id — api/tasks_board.go rejects patching
//     them, by design: capture_key is the permanent idempotency
//     key behind 0048's partial unique index and clearing it
//     would let capture re-mint a duplicate card. So a live
//     dispatcher run keeps looking like a captured card, and a
//     re-tail of its source todo would flip it to in_review
//     while status='running' and the worktree is still held.
//     worktree_path is the dispatcher's OWN ownership marker:
//     liveWorktreeCount (dispatch/service.go) defines a live
//     slot as exactly `worktree_path IS NOT NULL AND
//     board_column='in_progress'`, and admit writes the column
//     in the same UPDATE that writes board_column, so there is
//     no window in between. With board_column already pinned
//     above, this conjunct makes the capture set the exact
//     complement of that live set — the disjointness the
//     origin bullet claims, now stated in the dispatcher's own
//     terms. A card the user accepted but never dispatched has
//     worktree_path NULL and still moves, which is the whole
//     feature.
//
// Being a single guarded UPDATE also makes it race-safe against a user dragging
// the same card concurrently (last write wins; the WS frame reconciles the UI)
// and idempotent on replay — the second pass sees board_column='in_review',
// matches nothing, reports changes()==0, and stays silent.

// from two unrelated places — the ingest status ticker ages it to 'completed'
// (pipeline.recomputeStatuses) and the operator kill path flips it to 'killed'
// (internal/api.KillSession) — and neither should need more than a DB handle and

//
// SELECT-then-UPDATE inside ONE transaction, because the caller needs the ids

// CaptureSessionCard is hook B: the fallback card for a session that ended
// having captured nothing.
//
// Exported because a session reaches a terminal status from more than one place
// (the ingest status ticker ages it to 'completed'; the operator kill path in
// internal/api flips it to 'killed'), and each of those sites should be able to
// call this with nothing but a DB handle and a session id. It is safe to call
// repeatedly and from anywhere: every skip rule is re-evaluated and the
// 'sess:<uuid>' key makes a second call a no-op.
//
// Runs against *sql.DB rather than a transaction — it fires after the status
// UPDATE has committed, so there is no batch to join and nothing to roll back.
//
// Returns the task id and whether a card was REALLY inserted, so the caller
// publishes exactly one task_updated per new card and none for a repeat call.
// Never returns an error: a fallback card is best-effort by construction, and
// no failure here may disturb a status transition.
