// Package phasegate is THE completion gate for a plan phase: one derivation that
// answers "may this phase be recorded as complete?" and, when the answer is no,
// says why.
//
// It exists because completion used to be decided in four places from the same
// two columns (checkboxes_done / checkboxes_total) and nothing else — so a phase
// whose verification never ran read exactly like one that had been graded and
// passed. The store still holds the proof: a verification row 1.1 seconds long
// with an empty detail, and another reading "verifier did not run: fork/exec
// …/claude: no such file or directory". Both stamped INCONCLUSIVE, and both
// phases presented as done.
//
// Design notes, so this does not get widened by accident:
//
//   - The gate is ONE call returning ONE state plus reasons, not a set of
//     independent checks. An operator should see a single completion gate that can
//     cite more than one reason, rather than several half-gates each refusing for
//     its own cause. Later conditions (a mandatory Completion Report, a recorded
//     lesson) belong in Input and Result.Reasons — not in a second gate beside
//     this one.
//   - It is PURE: no DB, no clock, no git. Callers hand it the row's fields.
//   - It deliberately does NOT restate phasediag.Outcome. That vocabulary answers
//     "did work land?" and is closed on purpose (decision D5 rejected a
//     `completed-unverified` outcome, because it forks that one question in two).
//     This package answers a different question — "may we call it done?" — and
//     the two travel side by side.
//   - `fail` is NOT this gate's business. A phase graded FAIL keeps the behaviour
//     decision D5 settled: it reads as completed work with a verify-failed blocker
//     beside it. Turning FAIL into "not complete" here would silently re-open a
//     settled decision, and FAIL is already visible. The gate covers the case that
//     was invisible: an ABSENT verdict.

	// Ran reports whether this phase was actually EXECUTED by the daemon —

	// It gates the Completion Report condition, and the reason is fairness: the

	// an executor when the daemon runs a phase. A phase a human worked through by
	// hand was never handed that contract, so holding it to one is not enforcing
	// an agreement — it is inventing one retroactively, for work that is finished.
	//
	// This is not a hypothetical softening. Without it the gate reopened 48 of 49
	// completed plans in the live store and emptied the dashboard's Done tab. With
	// it, the gate bites on the three dispatched phases that genuinely shipped
