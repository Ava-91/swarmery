// Package staleness derives whether a task that CLAIMS to be running actually is,
// and says on what evidence.
//
// Derived, never persisted. For a source='workspace' row, tasks.status is a
// projection of the workspace artifacts: internal/wsingest upserts with
// `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE SET status = excluded.status`, so anything the daemon
// writes there is silently reverted on the next scan. A persisted verdict would be
// a second source of truth that drifts against the first. Same posture as
// internal/phasediag, which derives a run outcome from the row instead of adding a
// fourth persisted state.
//
// The audit that produced this package measured the cost of NOT having it: 42 tasks
// claiming `running` while every session tied to them had ended, holding 27.9% of
// all recorded spend, with nothing in any interface showing it.
