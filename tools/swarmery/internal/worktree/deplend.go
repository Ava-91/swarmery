package worktree

// `git worktree add` materializes only what is COMMITTED. An installed
// dependency tree is by construction NOT committed — node_modules, .venv and
// friends sit in .gitignore — so every fresh worktree starts with no toolchain
// at all, and the verification command a run's contract names fails on the
// environment instead of on the work.
//
// Observed 2026-08-10 (project handwrytten, phase-1 of an approved plan): the
// phase's own verification command, `npx jest tests/unit/<file>`, died in the
// fresh worktree with "Cannot find module '@babel/preset-env'". The phase could
// not have gone green no matter what the executor wrote.
//
// Installing per run is not the fix: it costs minutes of the run's wall clock
// every time, and a headless run's sandbox may refuse the network it needs.
// Lending the source checkout's ALREADY installed tree costs one symlink.
//
// Symlink, not copy, and the trade-off is deliberate:
//
//   - A dependency tree is routinely gigabytes; copying it per worktree would
//     dwarf the checkout it serves. Node and Python both resolve through
//     symlinked dependency roots natively (npm and pnpm build such links
//     themselves), so this is the boring path, not a trick.
//   - The tree is SHARED with the source checkout, so a run that reinstalls
//     (`npm ci`, `pip install`) mutates the developer's working copy. The run
//     prompts say so and tell executors not to reinstall — this file is the
//     reason that sentence exists.
//   - The link is only ever created when the worktree has nothing at that path,
//     so a project that genuinely commits its vendor directory keeps git's copy.
//
// A gitignored symlink does not show up in `git status --porcelain`, so a
// contract asserting a clean tree still holds.
