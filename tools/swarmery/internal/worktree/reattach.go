// to ask it a question, to continue where it stopped. The commits are all still
// on swarm/<taskID>; only the checkout was disposable.

// It is the deliberate opposite of Acquire in the one respect that matters here.

// no reset, no `branch -D`, and no force-removal of a directory that is present.
