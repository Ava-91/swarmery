// `git add -A` here mutates ONLY this worktree's own index — each worktree has
// its own — and the worktree is about to be deleted, so there is nothing to
// preserve. The repository's main checkout, its index and its HEAD are never
// touched: the ref is created with update-ref, not by checking anything out.
// Parallel sessions in the same repository therefore see nothing but a new ref
// appearing, which is the whole reason this is plumbing and not a commit.
//
// Every failure returns an error and NO branch, and the caller must treat that
// as "do not remove". A salvage that fails is the one thing that turns a
// removal back into a keep.
